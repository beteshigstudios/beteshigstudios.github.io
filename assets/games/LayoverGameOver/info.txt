Info: You're stuck in an endless loop of airports with absurd ritual-like challenges. You rush through security, kill time at the gate, scrambling to board your plane, faster each time. Just when you think you know the drill, you land at another airport. An even stranger one, over and over again.

Layover: Game Over is a WarioWare-style game with more than a dozen micro-game blitzes set in the world's most inexplicable airports.
