# BETESHIG Studios

> Small studio. Weird ideas. Serious games.

BETESHIG Studios is an indie game studio driven by a simple belief: great games come from spite, snacks, and an unhealthy attachment to pixel art. We've spent time honing our skills and building our voice — and now we're respawning as a real studio.
We build with Godot, create art in Aseprite, and craft 3D assets in Blender.
