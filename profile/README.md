# BETESHIG Studios

> Small studio. Serious games.

BETESHIG Studios is an indie game studio driven by a simple belief: great games come from passion, craft, and a genuine love of play. We've spent time honing our skills and building our voice — and now we're respawning as a real studio.

We build with Godot, create art in Aseprite, and craft 3D assets in Blender.

## Our Work

### Layover: Game Over
*[Play on itch.io](https://adisuciu.itch.io/layover-game-over)*

A WarioWare-style blitz of micro-games set in the world's most inexplicable airports. Rush through security, kill time at the gate, scramble to board — then do it all over again in an even stranger terminal.

### One Shot to Valhalla
*[Play on itch.io](https://adisuciu.itch.io/one-shot-to-valhalla)*

An Overcooked-style tower defense where you play as Magnus Drunkesson, a drunken Viking defending his closet from skeleton invaders — by manually reloading turrets that can only fire one shot at a time.

### FlatRoads
*[Play on itch.io](https://adisuciu.itch.io/flatroads)*

A top-down retro road construction game. Drive an SUV, operate a dozer, haul cargo with a truck — fix bridges, clear debris, and reach the tunnel to finish the level.

### Gravitaxi
*[Play on itch.io](https://adisuciu.itch.io/gravitaxi)*

Guide Gravitaxi to its destination through shifting platforms and moving obstacles across a series of increasingly tricky gravity-based levels.
